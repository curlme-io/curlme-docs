## What is curlme.io?

**curlme.io** is a terminal-first HTTP request debugging tool.

It allows developers to create temporary HTTP endpoints, capture incoming requests, inspect them in real time, replay traffic to local or remote targets, and diff payloads — directly from the terminal.

curlme focuses on requests, not dashboards.
