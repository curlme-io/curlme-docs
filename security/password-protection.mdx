description: "Secure your bins with password protection"

## Overview

Password protection adds an extra layer of security to your bins. When enabled, anyone accessing the bin via API or dashboard must provide the correct password.

## Enabling Protection

### Via Dashboard

1. Open your bin
2. Go to **"Settings"** tab
3. Enable **"Password Protection"**
4. Enter a strong password
5. Click **"Save"**

### Via API

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://curlme.io/api/bins/abc123 \
  -H "x-api-key: cm_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"password": "your_secure_password"}'
```

## Accessing Protected Bins

### Dashboard

When viewing a protected bin, you'll be prompted to enter the password.

### API

Include the password in the `x-bin-password` header:

```bash
curl https://curlme.io/api/bins/abc123 \
  -H "x-api-key: cm_your_api_key" \
  -H "x-bin-password: your_secure_password"
```

### CLI

The CLI will prompt for the password when accessing a protected bin:

```bash
curlme bin info abc123
# ? Bin password: ****
```

## What's Protected

When password protection is enabled:

| Action | Protected? |
| ------ | ---------- |
| View bin details | ✅ Yes |
| List requests | ✅ Yes |
| Update bin settings | ✅ Yes |
| Delete bin | ✅ Yes |
| **Receive webhooks** | ❌ No |

<Note>
  Incoming webhook requests are **not** blocked by password protection. The webhook endpoint always accepts requests.
</Note>

## Error Responses

### Missing Password

```bash
curl https://curlme.io/api/bins/abc123 \
  -H "x-api-key: cm_your_api_key"
```

Response (401):
```json
{
  "error": "Password required",
  "passwordRequired": true
}
```

### Wrong Password

```bash
curl https://curlme.io/api/bins/abc123 \
  -H "x-api-key: cm_your_api_key" \
  -H "x-bin-password: wrong_password"
```

Response (401):
```json
{
  "error": "Password required",
  "passwordRequired": true
}
```

## Removing Protection

### Via Dashboard

1. Open your bin settings
2. Disable **"Password Protection"**
3. Click **"Save"**

### Via API

Send an empty password:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://curlme.io/api/bins/abc123 \
  -H "x-api-key: cm_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"password": ""}'
```

## Password Storage

Passwords are hashed using SHA-256 before storage. The original password is never stored.

```
password → SHA-256 → stored hash
```

<Note>
  We cannot recover your password. If forgotten, you'll need to set a new one.

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Strong Passwords" icon="lock">
    At least 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Don't Share Passwords" icon="user-secret">
    Each team member should use their API key, not share bin passwords.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rotate Regularly" icon="rotate">
    Change passwords periodically, especially after team changes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use for Sensitive Data" icon="shield-check">
    Enable for bins receiving PII or sensitive webhook data.

## Use Cases

### Shared Development Bins

Password-protect bins used by multiple developers to prevent accidental access.

### Client Demos

Protect demo bins with client-specific passwords for presentations.

### Sensitive Webhooks

Add extra security for bins receiving payment or user data.

### Temporary Access

Share a bin's password for a specific task, then change it afterward.

## Limitations

- Passwords don't prevent webhook reception
- No per-request password (apply to entire bin)
- No password history or policy enforcement
- CLI may cache passwords temporarily

## Organization Bins

Password protection is available for organization bins:

- Any member can set/change the password
- Password is required for all members
- Admins can remove protection without the password
