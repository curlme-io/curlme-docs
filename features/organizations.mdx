## Overview

Organizations enable team collaboration by providing:

- **Shared bins**: All team members can access organization bins
- **Role-based access**: Control who can do what
- **Audit logs**: Track changes across the organization
- **Centralized management**: Manage bins and members in one place

## Personal Organization

Every user automatically gets a **Personal Organization** when they sign up. This is where your individual bins live by default.

<Note>
  Your personal organization cannot be deleted. It's automatically created when you sign in.

  -H "x-api-key: cm_your_api_key"
```

<Note>
  You cannot delete your personal organization.

## Switching Organizations

### In Dashboard

Use the organization dropdown in the header to switch between organizations.

### In CLI

The CLI uses your default organization. To work with a specific organization's bins:

```bash
# List bins for a specific organization
curlme bin list --org org_abc123
```
