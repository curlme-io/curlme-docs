## Overview

Request bins are unique HTTP endpoints that capture and store all incoming requests. They're perfect for:

- **Webhook debugging**: Inspect payloads from Stripe, GitHub, Twilio, etc.
- **API development**: Test your integration before deploying
- **Debugging**: Capture requests from mobile apps or IoT devices
- **Demos**: Show clients exactly what data you're receiving

## Creating a Bin

### Via CLI

```bash
curlme bin create my-webhook-bin
```

### Via Dashboard

1. Go to [curlme.io/dashboard](https://curlme.io/dashboard)
2. Click **"Create New Bin"**
3. Enter a name and click **"Create"**

### Via API

```bash
curl -X POST https://curlme.io/api/bins \
  -H "x-api-key: cm_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-webhook-bin"}'
```

## Bin Endpoints

Each bin exposes two URLs:

| URL | Purpose |
| --- | ------- |
| `https://curlme.io/h/{publicId}` | Webhook endpoint (accepts any HTTP method) |
| `https://curlme.io/bin/{publicId}` | Dashboard view |

### Short URL

For convenience, you can use the short URL format:

```
https://curlme.io/h/abc123
```

This redirects to the full hook endpoint and captures all request data.

## Supported Methods

Bins accept all HTTP methods:

- `GET`
- `POST`
- `PUT`
- `PATCH`
- `DELETE`
- `OPTIONS`
- `HEAD`

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="path" type="string">

<ResponseField name="headers" type="object">

<ResponseField name="body" type="string">

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="contentType" type="string">

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="ip" type="string">
  Client IP address
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="timestamp" type="number">
  Unix timestamp in milliseconds
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="size" type="number">
  Request body size in bytes
</ResponseField>

## Bin Settings

### Name & Description

Give your bin a meaningful name and optional description:

```bash
curlme bin update abc123 --name "Stripe Webhooks" --description "Production events"
```

### Retention

Configure how long requests are stored:

```json
{
  "retentionHours": 168  // 7 days
}
```

Set to `0` for indefinite retention (plan limits apply).

### Tags

Organize bins with tags for filtering:

```json
{
  "tags": ["production", "stripe", "payments"]
}
```

## Listing Bins

### CLI

```bash
curlme bin list
```

```
Bins
  → abc123xyz            Stripe Webhooks       42 reqs
    def456uvw            GitHub Actions        15 reqs
    ghi789rst            Development           3 reqs
```

### API

```bash
curl https://curlme.io/api/bins \
  -H "x-api-key: cm_your_api_key"
```

## Deleting Bins

<Warning>
  Deleting a bin permanently removes all captured requests. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

### CLI

```bash
curlme bin delete abc123
```

### API

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://curlme.io/api/bins/abc123 \
  -H "x-api-key: cm_your_api_key"
```

### Clear Requests Only

To keep the bin but clear all requests:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://curlme.io/api/bins/abc123?clearRequests=true" \
  -H "x-api-key: cm_your_api_key"
```

## Organization Bins

Bins can belong to an organization for team sharing:

```bash
curl -X POST https://curlme.io/api/bins \
  -H "x-api-key: cm_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Team Webhooks", "organizationId": "org_123"}'
```

All organization members can view and manage organization bins based on their role.

## Temporary Bins

Create bins without authentication for quick testing:

```bash
curl -X POST https://curlme.io/api/bins
```

<Note>
  Temporary bins are deleted after 24 hours and have limited features.
