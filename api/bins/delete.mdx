## Operations

### Delete Bin

Permanently deletes the bin and all its requests:

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://curlme.io/api/bins/abc123xyz \
  -H "x-api-key: cm_your_api_key"
```

<Warning>
  This action is irreversible. All captured requests are permanently lost.
</Warning>

### Clear Requests Only

Removes all requests but keeps the bin:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://curlme.io/api/bins/abc123xyz?clearRequests=true" \
  -H "x-api-key: cm_your_api_key"
```

This is useful when you want to:
- Reset a bin for new testing
- Clear sensitive data while keeping the endpoint active
- Start fresh without creating a new bin URL

## Errors

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key |
| `403` | Permission denied - Not your bin |
| `404` | Bin not found |

## Permissions

- You can only delete bins you own
- Organization members can delete organization bins based on their role
- Temporary bins can be deleted by anyone with the ID

## Related

After deleting a bin, the webhook URL becomes inactive:

```bash
# This will return 404 after deletion
curl https://curlme.io/h/abc123xyz
```
